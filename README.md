# Numerical Analysis Exercises

Ensemble of numerical analysis exercises from the graduate course in numerical methods for partial differential equations. It includes finite differences implementation to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in a non-rectangular domain, triangular mesh creation algorithm as well as linear and quadratic finite elements codes to solve the 2-D Helmholtz problem and Poisson's equation respectively.
