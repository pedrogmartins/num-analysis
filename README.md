# Numerical Analysis Exercises

This is an ensemble of numerical analysis exercises from graduate course in numerical methods for partial differential equations. It includes finite differences implementation to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in non-rectangular domain, triangular mesh creation algorithm and finally linear and quadratic finite elements codes to solve respectively the 2-D Helmholtz problem and Poisson's equation.
